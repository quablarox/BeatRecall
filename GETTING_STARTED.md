## 🚀 2. Choose Your Path (3 min)

> **📚 Detailed paths:** See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for complete role-specific guides

### 👨‍💻 **Developer** → Start Coding

**Quick Path:**
1. [Development Setup](docs/engineering/setup/development_setup.md) - Environment setup
2. [Architecture](docs/engineering/architecture/architecture.md) - Code structure & naming
3. [API Contracts](docs/engineering/architecture/api_contracts.md) - Interfaces & DI
4. [Testing Strategy](docs/engineering/testing/testing_strategy.md) - How to test

**Quick Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Clone repository (when available)
git clone https://github.com/quablarox/BeatRecall.git
cd BeatRecall

# App source code lives in ./app
cd app

# 2. Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

# 3. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 4. Run app
flutter run

# 5. Run tests
flutter test
```

**Key Principles:**
- **SRS Correctness > UI Polish** - Algorithm must be correct
- **Domain Language** - Use exact terms from [GLOSSARY](docs/product/GLOSSARY.md)
- **Test Coverage** - 70% minimum, 90% for business logic
- **Naming** - See [Architecture](docs/engineering/architecture/architecture.md#3-naming-conventions)

## 🎯 4. Current Status

**Phase 1 - Sprint 4.7:** Minute-Based Intervals & Queue Management (Complete)

**Sprint 4.7 Deliverables:**
- ✅ Minute-level time resolution (1m, 10m, 1h, 1d, 3d, 1w, 1mo)
- ✅ Anki-style learning steps (Again=1m, Hard=10m, Good=1d→3d, Easy=4d)
- ✅ Dynamic queue management (cards shown only when due)
- ✅ Deterministic ordering (nextReviewDate + UUID)
- ✅ New cards inserted on-demand between due cards
- ✅ **Test Suite:** 224 passing tests

**Previous Sprint (4.5-4.6):**
- ✅ Continuous session mode & daily new cards limit
- ✅ Enhanced interval display on rating buttons
